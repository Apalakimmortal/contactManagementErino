### **Project Description:**
The Contact Management Website is a web application built using **Django** (backend framework), **SQLite** (database), and **Bootstrap** (frontend framework). It allows users to efficiently manage contacts by adding, updating, deleting, and searching for contact details.

### **Major Technical Decisions:**
1. **Framework Choice**:
   - **Django**: Chosen for its robust ORM, rapid development capabilities, and ease of handling CRUD operations.
   - **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based database ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

2. **Frontend Design**:
   - **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive and clean UI components without needing extensive custom CSS.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Models handle data.
   - Views handle business logic.
   - Templates render the user interface.

---

### **How Each Part Works:**

#### **1. Models (Database Layer)**:
- The `UserModel` is used to define fields such as `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, `company`, and `job_title`.
- **How it works**:
  - Stores all user data in a structured format.
  - Facilitates easy querying, filtering, and manipulation of records.

#### **2. Views (Business Logic)**:
- **`user_list_create` View**:
  - Handles displaying a list of users.
  - Processes form submissions for adding new contacts.
  - Supports search functionality to filter contacts by name.
- **`delete_user` View**:
  - Retrieves a contact by ID and deletes it from the database.
- **`update_user` View**:
  - Retrieves a specific contact by ID, pre-populates its details in a form, and updates them upon submission.

#### **3. Templates (Presentation Layer)**:
- HTML templates with **Django Template Tags** dynamically render content, such as:
  - Listing all users with details.
  - Displaying forms for adding or updating contacts.
  - Showing search results in real time.
- **How it works**:
  - Template tags like `{% for user in users %}` are used to loop through user records.
  - Forms use `{% csrf_token %}` for secure POST requests.

#### **4. Static Files (CSS and JavaScript)**:
- **Bootstrap** ensures a responsive, user-friendly interface with components like tables, buttons, and form styling.

#### **5. Search Functionality**:
- The `search` parameter in the `GET` request is processed in the `user_list_create` view to filter contacts using case-insensitive matching.

#### **6. CRUD Operations**:
- **Create**: Users can add new contacts using a form.
- **Read**: A paginated list of all contacts is displayed.
- **Update**: Users can edit contact details via pre-filled forms.
- **Delete**: Users can remove unwanted contacts with a single click.

### **Key Features:**
1. Add and manage contact details.
2. Search functionality for quick access to specific contacts.
3. Simple and clean UI with responsive design.
4. Database operations are seamless with Django ORM.
